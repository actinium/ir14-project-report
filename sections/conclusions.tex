\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Creating a replacement for the original Solr suggester that also completes field names and queries beginning with field specifiers is feasible. While Solr does have a suggester implementation one can delegate most of the relevant work to, using Solr implies a number of needless complications resulting from the fact that it is often difficult to avoid the query tokenization that Solr ordinarily does. This necessitates a number of workarounds if one wants to avoid the preprocessing, such as tokenization, of the query.

However, we are happy with the overall results of the project. We feel that we have produced a suggester that implements the intended functionality. Still, there is more work that can be done to further enhance the query completion experience.
