\section{Results}\label{results}

As can be seen in the table below, the query completion module implements the intended functionality and is capable of suggesting field names and values within specified fields. It is capable of suggesting completions for multi-word values, such as suggesting |name:"désirée pethrus| for the query |name:"désirée p|. It also retains the functionality of the built-in suggester.\\
