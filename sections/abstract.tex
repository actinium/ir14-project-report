This project looks at new ways to utilize query completion for advanced users of Apache Solr, with knowledge of the underlying structure of the data. The main goal is to enable query completion for field names, and data within specific fields when a field is present within the query. This has been done by implementing a custom Suggester component for Apache Solr. With the help of this component advanced users can more quickly find what they are looking for, with total recall and maximal precision.
